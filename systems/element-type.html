    <h2>Element Types</h2>
    <p>Each Element Type has its own strengths and weaknesses against other Element Types, creating a dynamic system of interactions that can influence combat strategies, puzzle-solving, and environmental navigation.
        There are 7 Element Types: <a href="./aqua.html">Aqua</a>, <a href="./ignis.html">Ignis</a>, <a href="./terra.html">Terra</a>, <a href="./aero.html">Aero</a>, <a href="./lumen.html">Lumen</a>, <a href="./umbra.html">Umbra</a> and <a href="./vis.html">Vis</a>.
    </p>
